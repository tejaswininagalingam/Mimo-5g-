# MIMO 5G ANTENNA PATCH SYSTEM IN SMARTPHONES
My internship at Maestrominds where I have created 2 simulations on patch antenna system. I have attached the working of a single patch and 2*2 patch system, where I have gained the results using s parameter analysis.
Initially, as I'm a fresher, doing or exploring projects were hard but as soon as landed with the software,CST STUDIO, it was interesting to work on and I gained a lot of knowledge on how to to design. 
The skills and knowledge I learned would really help in future.
